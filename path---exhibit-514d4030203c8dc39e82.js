The Glass Room is a space for reflection, experimentation and play that provides different ways of understanding how technologies and data are changing our lives. The Glass Room puts big data on display in ways that make it tangible and less abstract. What does your data say about you, and how is it being used to define you? What do you give up in exchange? How are data and technology changing the personal, professional and social fabric of all of our lives?</p>\n<p>The Data Detox Bar is where you can get one-to-one advice and simple tips and tricks on how to protect your privacy online and reclaim your digital self.

James Bridle / @jamesbridle",text:"Your phone can keep your memories much longer than you can. As artist James Bridle puts it, ‘This digital memory sits somewhere between experience and non-experience; it is also an approximation; it is also a lie.’ The data your smartphone tracks and stores about where you go and where you’ve been has the highest value for data brokers because it gives them a detailed map of your behaviour and your social graph, but it is also an approximation based on the device’s way of seeing and the invisible infrastructure it communicates with.\n\nFrom June 2010 to April 2011 anyone with an iPhone unknowingly had their locations mapped and saved in Apple’s databases, and it’s still not clear what’s become of all those dropped pins and destinations. Bridle’s publication is a reminder of the permanent memories the devices around us contain and how much information can be extrapolated from them.\n",url:["https://wikipedia.de"]}]}}},pathContext:{slug:"/exhibit"}}}});
