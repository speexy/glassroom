We’ve found it works best in busy places with plenty of free space, or as part of a bigger event. It can be set up for anytime from 2 -3 days to a longer period. It can also be set up as a longer term exhibition in libraries and other public buildings.</p>\n<p>The exhibit is visually striking and can adapt to most spaces. Generally, visitors browse the exhibits for between 5 to 15 minutes. It works as a stand-alone installation – all the exhibits have simple explanations. But it works even better if there is one or more people on hand as  “Data Detox Baristas” to explain the exhibit or give tips and advice on online privacy.</p>\n<p>We’ll send you The Glass Room Experience set, including:\nA set of Glass Room posters\nPens, a magnifying glass, and a dome, and sticker strips\nA USB stick with our videoa and animations\nFull instructions on setting up The Glass Room Experience.
