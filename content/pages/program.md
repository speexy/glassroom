  The Our Data, Our Selves Programme presented leading voices illuminating the role technology plays on society, culture and individuals, through a series of discussions, films, workshops and talks that explored aspects of living in a quantified society.  Along side the event programme, Tactical Tech trained Ingeniuses ran [Ingenius Workshops](https://web.archive.org/web/20180129023912/https://theglassroom.org/programme/#ingenius_workshops) that offered practical tools and resources to empower more control of your data.
