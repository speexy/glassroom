    title: Making Choices in your Digital Life
    text: |
      Whatsapp, Gmail, Google Search – we use these apps and tools because everyone else does, and because… what else is there? This workshop was designed to enable you to think more critically about the tools you use, what questions you should ask, and why the answers matter. It introduced some alternative chat apps, email providers, and search tools to allow you to take more control of your own data.
